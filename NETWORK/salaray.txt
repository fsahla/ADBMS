Gross Salary: is the amount of salary paid after adding all benefits and allowances and
before deducting any tax
Net Salary: is what is left of your salary after deductions have been made.
Take Home Salary: Is usually the Net Salary unless there are some personal deductions like
loan or bond re-payments.
Cost to Company: Companies use the term “Cost to Company” to calculate the total cost to
employ. I.e. all the costs associated with an employment contract. Major part of CTC
comprises of compulsory deductibles. These include deductions for provident fund, medical
insurance etc. They form a part of your compensation structure but you not get them as a part
of in-hand salary. As such, although it increases your CTC, it does not increment your net
salary.
